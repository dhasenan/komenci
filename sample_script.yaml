  # However, it doesn't ensure they're mounted with the correct options.
  # So, we run mount -a, then we see if we need to remount /.
  # Not all systems require this. We try to detect if you want / to be readonly
  # and only remount in that case. However, we don't guarantee that this is
  # correct, so feel free to edit as necessary.
